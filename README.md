# Data Structures and Algorithms

Learn collections of data structures and algorithms

## Big O Notation

- used to describe the performance of an algorithm

- to determine an algorithm is scalable or not as input grows large

```
O(1)        algorithm run in constant time
O(n)        cost of algorithm grows linearly
O(n ^ 2)    cost of algorithm grows in quadratic time  
O(log n)    as input grows, it slows down the curve. efficient than linear
```
